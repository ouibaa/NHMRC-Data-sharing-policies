Rationale
- develop data sharing standards
- individual participant data sharing has support in scientific community, esp if de-identified/anonymised
- Data ownership -> custodianship/stewardship
	- Statistical advances improving data sharing
- still low commitment to sharing data
	- determined by policy
	- policy, security, interoperability

Objectives
- assessing existing data sharing policies, whether they recommend or require data sharing, and summarising characteristics of existing policies ...

1. Health research funders
	- requiring data sharing by funders = increased compliance
	- reducing research waste + maximise utility of research
	- reduces duplication of research
	- curated and stored to higher quality
	- 40% of commercial and non-commercial funders have data sharing policy; of those, 40% mandated, 60% encouraged
	- public and philanthropic funders / private funders
		- Vierger et al identified largest funders
		- EU scoreboard per industry - can rank by research and development
2. Institutional review boards
	- no studies done on this, though hard to assess
	- strengthen licence of acceptability of research, ethical approval
	- supports high quality datasets
	- informed consent / approvla from their board
	- our study will look at largest review boards from country with primary registry of data provider will be included
		- how will we identify this? different countries structure this differently (diff approaches)
3. CT registries
	- No studies
	- facilitates reproduction and reanalysis
	- guide evidence syntheis
	- indirect outcome of registries
	- ICJME requires registration in a registry or CT.gov
4. Journals
	- 4 main studies
	- can support peer reviewed journals
	- 44% have no data sharing policy, 18% encouraged, 38% mandated
	- most have no giuidance
	- higher impact = stronger data sharing, no association w/ published/open accept/subscription
	- rarely enforced 
	- no correlation between saying you have data and actulaly sharing data

Look at largest journal in medicine
